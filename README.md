# FORTRAN snippets

> I don't know what the technical characteristics of
the standard language for scientific and engineering
computation in the year 2000 will be... but I know it
will be called Fortran.  -- Quote by John Backus

This repository is designed as case study to see how things can be implemented in FORTRAN. It will mostly cover different things how to program cleaner in FORTRAN and is intendant as a supplement to standard books in FORTRAN.

Feel free to do with this repository anything you want to do. If you check the snippets and you have suggestions, then you will get a symbolic reward of a nice generous person üëè.
